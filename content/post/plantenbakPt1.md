Today I would like to write about a useless project that I am working on. Do you know the struggle to water your plants on time? For me this was the reason to not have these handy \\(CO_2\\) to \\(O_2\\) converters, as I want to spare them the missery. However, back in december I was celebrating the "beun" version of Sinterklaas (Sinterbeun) with some friends of mine. The idea was to give each other a beun project as a gift. My friend Berend created a plant box that monitors the soil humidity of the plant that was placed in the pot. This was really cool, because you can monitor the humidity to check whether the plant is thirsty or not. The plant in question was a cactus, so it probably did not require this astute monitoring system. However, it looked quite cool.
