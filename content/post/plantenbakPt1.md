# Preface
Today I would like to write about a useless project that I am working on. Do you know the struggle to water your plants on time? For me this was the reason to not have these handy carbon dioxide to oxide converters, as I want to spare them the missery. However, back in december I was celebrating the "beun" version of Sinterklaas (Sinterbeun) with some friends of mine. The idea was to give each other a beun project as a gift. My friend Berend created a plant box that monitors the soil humidity of the plant that was placed in the pot. This was really cool, because you can monitor the humidity to check whether the plant is thirsty or not. The plant in question was a cactus, so it probably did not require this astute monitoring system. However, it looked quite cool.

# Plan of Attack
Well, there was no plan. I liked the type of wood that Berend used on his DIY creation, so I purchased a 180x14 cm piece of impregnated wood. With some trial and error (always place finished planks away from the remainder pieces :) ). I hacked this thing together:

The main difference with the earlier unit, is that this one can hold up to two plants! There is also a compartment in the middle where you can store all the electronics and stuff. As you can see on the pictures, it is elevated a litte bit. This looks like a fancy feature that I added to present all the beautiful electronics within, but it is a result of my stupidity :p.
