A year has 365.25 days or 8766 hours on average. This is a lot of time that can be used for all kind of things. I don't know about you, but I lose track of most of the things that I actually pursue on a long term. From now on, I would like to write about things that I do or interest me. I hope that over time, this page gets full of all kind of things that  I can look back to. 

Another reason to start this blog, is that I always learned a lot from blogs myself. Now that I sometimes know what I am doing, it might be time to return the favour to those who are interested. 

Enjoy!

Erik
